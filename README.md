Hey. 

If you are a company looking for a new dev, my website sells myself already ;), for the others.. welcome to my second code project ! (I will talk about my personnal life for the next few lines, skip to line 11 if you want to know what am i doing.)

So i've been trying to make a game in the past few months, named "Found". It's a 2D adventure game made in Unity and in developped in C#. 
I am not going to lie, it's pretty rough and not user friendly, but..
I'm still working on it ! this project is tho, on the side of my life for the moment because of my studies that takes me loads of time. 

For anyone who wanted to know, everything i code is not for school project but for fun/professional reasons. that leads us to..

My portfolio !

Yes indeed, this project is my very first (and very own !) web developpement project. For the moment i write those lines (04/03/25) there's only HTML and CSS. But soon, i will add react to make 
the website dynamic. I'm still a rookie in the world of computer science, so if you got any advice, i'm taking it !

Spread love, we are all humans.
